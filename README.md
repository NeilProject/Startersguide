# Startersguide

A quick starter's guide to Neil. Don't expect too much from it... this is just a quick guide to get you on the road. Most of all aimed for those without programming experience, but with a few notes. And if you have any questions, just [hop over to the NIL and Neil forum](https://nillanguage.freeforums.net/) and ask about it.
